You could follow the use of this plugin by this one :https://github.com/berteh/musescore-chordsToNotes (also here: https://musescore.org/en/node/62481). This would generate the chords symbols, then transform them into real chords (not symbols) playable by musescore.

	If you use it, make sure to safe your work.
	There's no guarantee the plugin won't corrupt your score. (though it should not).
