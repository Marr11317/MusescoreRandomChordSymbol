RandomChordsSymbolGenerator
===================

A plugin for MuseScore version 2.1 to create a new score with random chord symbols in it. You could follow the use of this plugin by this one :https://github.com/berteh/musescore-chordsToNotes (also here: https://musescore.org/en/node/62481). This would generate the chords symbols, then transform them into real chords (not symbols) playable by musescore.

By aware that:
	The plugin is still under development.
	If you use it, make sure to safe your work.
	There's no guarantee the plugin won't corrupt your score. (though it should not).
